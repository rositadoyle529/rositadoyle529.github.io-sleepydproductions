		<h1> About Sleepy D </h1>
			<div class = "bio">
			<p>
			As a child, Sleepy D never really had any goals aside from wanting a vast span of land alongside a few pets, because that sounds like a good time. As he grew older, he soon realized that a profession was needed in order to make something like this happen, and he turned to his main activity as his inspiration: the production and engineering of music and sound. 
			</p>

			<p>After playing guitar in rock, metal and jazz bands for seven years, Sleepy D made the decision to attend Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts.
			</p>

			<p>
			While attending Berklee, Sleepy D learned the necessary skills to produce and engineer musicians to their fullest potential, designing soundscapes that fit the artist's needs in the process. He also aquired the skill of mixing and mastering every artist, ranging from pop, to djent, to funk,to orchestral, with his expertise highest in <strong>R&B and Hip-hop</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
			Sleepy D currently produces, mixes, and masters in Boston, MA, with a focus on quality, not quantity, when it comes to the artist.
